## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project for a Udacity Nanodegree, I was interestested in using Airbnb open data from Seattle 2016 to better understand:

1. Are there any seasonal courses in price and number of listings?
2. Are certain areas in Seattle particularly expensive and are there seasonal trends/differences?
3. What other factors affect the Airbnb prices in Seattle?
4. What might be a valid predictor of a "reasonable" price for potential hosts or guests?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one Jupiter Notebook File (Project 1 Write a Data Science Blog Post v1.ipynb) available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

The used source data set is Airbnb open data from Seattle 2016, wich is available at the Kaggle.com [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data).
The data set for seattle consists of three individual csv-files:
- calendar.csv
- listings.csv
- reviews.csv

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle and Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data).  
Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
