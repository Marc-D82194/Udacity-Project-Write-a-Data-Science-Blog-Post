## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb open data from Seattle 2016 to better understand:

1. Are there any seasonal courses in price and number of listings?
2. Are certain areas in Seattle particularly expensive and are there seasonal trends/differences?
3. What other factors affect the Airbnb prices in Seattle?
4. What might be a valid predictor of a "reasonable" price for potential hosts or guests?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There ia 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the analysys and modeles usedes to anser the 3 questions and predict price.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle and Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data).  
Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
